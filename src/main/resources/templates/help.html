		<h1>Welcome to the help page for the FileExplorer WebApp!</h1>
		<br>

		<h2>Purpose of this software:</h2>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-left: 50px;">This software was made to create a
			user friendly file explorer system that utilizes already existing
			technology in browsers to display files. This was due to my
			dissatisfaction with current file explorers and the inability to add
			tags to files and search properly. Even though MacOS allows you to
			add tags, I dislike the rest of the UI to the point where it is
			unusable and I prefer using my terminal and spamming &quot;cd.&quot;
			and &quot;ls&quot;</p>
		<br>

		<h2>File management:</h2>
		<br>

		<h3>Uploading files:</h3>
		<p>Currently, you may only load a directory at a time, and any
			directory you select will have every file in it, and its
			subdirectories uploaded. To upload files, look at the top of the page
			at the bar that says &quot;Directory to seed&quot; and enter the
			absolute path of the directory you wish to seed. Please not that this
			must be an absolute path from your root directory. The directory
			traverser will recursively go through all of the files and
			directories in the initial directory provided and shortly update your
			view with all of your files. Once you see the file icons, you may
			click on any of them to begin viewing and interacting with them.</p>
		<br>


		<h3>Adding tags to files:</h3>
		<p>To add a tag to a file you have already uploaded, you must
			first click on the file and enter the page to view it. Below the
			displayed file will be a few options, below that will be a text box
			where you may enter your desired tags. You must separate each tag by
			a comma and none of your tags may contain the &quot;|&quot;
			character.</p>


		<h3>Searching through files:</h3>
		<p>Files are searched by either exact name or their tags. If you
			want to find a specific file, you must know its exact name, or tags
			unique to that file. Currently only one search term at a time is
			supported, but updates are coming. In order to search an item by tag,
			you must first add tags to this item.</p>


		<h2>Account management:</h2>
		<br>
		<p>The user has the option of making their own account if they
			have preferences they would like to save. Otherwise, this software
			has a &quot;default&quot; user upon first initialization which
			behaves like any other user, except is automatically logged in upon
			startup and requires no verification. If the user has ANY desire for
			privacy, they should make an account.</p>


		<h3>Creating an account:</h3>
		<p>In order to create an account, hover your mouse over the menu
			button on the banner and select &quot;Log In/Sign Up.&quot; There,
			you will be directed to a page where you can log into an already
			existing account or you can create a new one. Your account must have
			a username not used by any previous accounts.</p>


		<h3>Saving your account:</h3>
		<p>
			To save your account, make your way over to the menu button and click
			&quot;Save Session.&quot; This will automatically save your account
			information for your use the next time you log in. <b>NOTE:</b> this
			will override any previous information, so files removed will be lost
			to the software if you save your session. <b>NOTE:</b> your
			information will only be saved if you manually save your session,
			otherwise you will not see any changes you made upon logging in
			again.
